(WIP) Contains data visualizations and [in the future] code for my research project on modelling Arctic surface currents!

Guide:
- markov_eigenvectors.jpg: A collection of eigenvector pairs, sorted by eigenvalue, of the Markov matrix constructed by binning. They are paired as left and right vectors, where the left eigenvector corresponds to a near-invariant set and the corresponding right eigenvector corresponds to its basin of attraction.
- kernel_eigenvectors.jpg: A collection of eigenvector pairs, sorted by eigenvalue, of the Markov operator on an orthonormal eigenbasis of a kernel operator. Identical in format to the previous file.
- fw_markov.jpg: A sample of the evolution of a probability density over time according to the model implied by the Markov operator from the binning approach.
- fw_kernel.jpg: A sample of the evolution of a probability density over time according to the model implied by the Markov operator from the kernel basis approach.

The relative consistency across the models, and in the behaviour of the models on probability densities, lends credence to the validity of the methods.
